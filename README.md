# Cody-Kietzman-Challenge-4
Repo for Challenge 4

The quiz and timer element of this challenge work great.  The quesitons cycle through and it will check if the answer button selected is the correct answer for the question.  The timer will deduct 10 seconds for every wrong answer.  When the quiz is done it will tell you the score and you can input your initials.  This is where I ran into problems and could not manipulate my local storage.  I spend 4+ hours in office hours and tutoring sessions but they were unable to help as well.  The local storage will be an issue I continue to work on, but since the challenge is mostly complete I wanted to submit and move onto the next material and activity.
